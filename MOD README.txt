 Installation
==============

 Changes/Additions
===================

- Added new augment, NANOBOT_DEFENSE_SYSTEM (disabled by default)
- Explosive Replicator's <value> tag now works as intended
- Added ih8ih8sn0w's infinite mode (enabled in hyperspace.xml)
- Fixed hacking drone bypass bug - the drone now explodes when hacking is depowered (enabled by default -- can change in hyperspace.xml)
- Can now enable command console through hyperspace.xml
  > Added STORE command
- Can now enable Hull Numbers through hyperspace.xml
- Ghosts can now phase through doors

- Added creation of custom races
  > Their abilities can be changed inside the hyperspace.xml
  > Existing crewmembers can also have their abilities changed, but you will need to rewrite the old abilities as well
  > Create a blueprint for them and put their definition in the <crew> tag in hyperspace.xml
  
- Added infinite ship list
  > The number of pages increases the more ships you have to fill them
  > Ships can be added by having a custom blueprint for them, and adding their id to the <ships> in hyperspace.xml
  > NOTE: High scores for custom ships are never saved, and they have no achievements

- Added custom augments (sort of)
  > Different augments can now be combined to make a new augment
  > Create a blueprint for the augment, then add their definition to the <augments> in hyperspace.xml
  > This can also be used to make new versions of old augments, so that the player and enemy can have seperate values for one augment, for example

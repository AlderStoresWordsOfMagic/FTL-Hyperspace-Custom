 TODO: We may want to hide CApp in the metatable so it looks like just a getter/global variable of the Hyperspace module
 TODO: We may want to hide Global::GetShipManager(0) as `ships.player` in the metatable so it looks like a getter global variable
 TODO: We may want to do the same with Global::GetShipManager(1) as `ships.enemy`
 ^^^^ Note all of the above require doing this with the Lua C API (Rather than some SWIG shortcut) although it may be simnpler to just do it in Lua while still having it secretly accessible under another path
 Maybe at some point we make most of the `Hyperspace` module internal and just pull out various functions & expose them to a different table in Lua so we can control the final naming of everything, and then we can hide the `Hyperspace` table after our rewrite code has run.

Since those are two completely flipping unrelated classes that have to be gotten via a completely different path of CApp->World->playerShip (CompleteShip) and CApp->World->bossShip (BossShip) and can't be retreived from the damn ShipManager?
    That is assuming we actually need to expose anything from those... like CompleteShip:KillRandomCrew() or maybe we make some new table and just bring in methods from both.
    We could totally return another metatable so that things like `ships.player:KillRandomCrew()` could access `CompleteShip` while `ships.player:DamageHull()` could route to `ShipManager`'s function internally (kinda a manual multiple inheritance)

    By default in Codeblocks SWIG settings we don't get the regular preprocessor defines, ideally we should switch between which FTLGame we import.
    To avoid having to change codeblocks compiler settings (that don't save/share between our installs) we're going to just try to use the
    Linux64 file for now. Since SWIG only uses this for method & field names but not for actual access to the address (the regular headers are
    loaded at compile time) unless we want to access a field in Lua not available to the other versions there is no concern.
